Quiz 1 keeps `arithmetic operators` and `0 as condition` at the beginning and randomizes the order of all remaining questions.

Quiz 2 randomizes the order of all questions.

Quiz 3 organizes questions into question groups. The order of groups
is randomized. Questions within the same group are presented in a row
but in a randomized order. Questions named as
`fun and state i/4` are in the same group. Questions named as
`eq? fun fun i/3` are in another group. Each one of the
remaining questions has its own group.
